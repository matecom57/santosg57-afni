https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_Functional_NeuroImages

A package of computer programs for analysis and visualization of three-dimensional human brain functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (FMRI) results is described. The software can color overlay neural activation maps onto higher 
resolution anatomical scans. Slices in each cardinal plane can be viewed simultaneously. Manual placement of markers 
on anatomical landmarks allows transformation of anatomical and functional scans into stereotaxic (Talairachâ€“Tournoux) 
coordinates. The techniques for automatically generating transformed functional data sets from manually labeled 
anatomical data sets are described. Facilities are provided for several types of statistical analyses of multiple 3D 
functional data sets. The programs are written in ANSI C and Motif 1.2 to run on Unix workstations.
